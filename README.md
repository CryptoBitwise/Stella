## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Quick Start (Local Development)

1. Download all the files to a folder
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or the app will use CDN fallback)
3. Open `generate-icons.html` in your browser to create app icons
4. Save the generated icons to an `icons/` folder
5. Open `index.html` in your browser
6. Use Shift + mouse movement to look around (or touch/drag on mobile)

### Option 2: Professional Star Catalog (Recommended)

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Generate the star catalog: `node process-stars.js`
3. Integrate stars into your app: `node integrate-stars.js`
4. Your app now has 100+ real stars with accurate data!

### Option 3: Deploy to Web Server

1. Upload all files to any web server (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
2. Make sure your server supports HTTPS (required for PWA features)
3. Visit your website - users can now install it as an app!

### Option 4: Local Server (Recommended for Development)

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve .

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

### Professional Star Catalog

For a truly professional experience, use the included star catalog processor:

1. **HYG v4.2 Catalog** - Downloads the Yale Bright Star Catalog
2. **100+ Visible Stars** - All stars visible to the naked eye
3. **Real Astronomical Data** - Accurate coordinates, magnitudes, distances
4. **Enhanced Constellations** - More constellation patterns
5. **Auto-generated Facts** - Interesting information about each star

The processor filters stars by magnitude < 6.5 (naked eye visibility) and includes:

- Proper names (when available)
- Constellation assignments
- Spectral types
- Distance data in light years
- Right ascension and declination coordinates
